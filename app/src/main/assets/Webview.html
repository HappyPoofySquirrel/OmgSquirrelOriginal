<font color="white"><p>Squirrels are familiar creatures to many of us. We see them day-in and day-out, scurrying up trees or running across the road, but how much do we really know about them? There are more than 200 species of squirrels, with weights ranging from 0.35 oz to 18 lbs and lengths from 5 inches up to 3 feet. They are indigenous to regions as diverse as the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and they have even been introduced to Australia. They subsist mainly on nuts and seeds, but sometimes also eat insects or small vertebrates. Squirrels can be categorized as one of three types: tree squirrels, ground squirrels or flying squirrels.</p></font>

<font color="white"><h2>Tree Squirrels</h2></font>
<font color="white"><p>Gray, red, fox, and tufted-ear squirrels are few breeds of tree squirrel. Tree squirrels have long bushy tails and sharp claws. They build nests in hollow tree trunks or in the forks of branches. Tree squirrels hide their food in many different small caches in the fall. During winter they rely on these caches for meals.</p></font>

<font color="white"><h2>Ground Squirrels</h2></font>
<font color="white"><p>Chipmunks, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and marmots are considered ground squirrels. They sleep, mate and nest in tunnels or burrows underground, spending their days foraging for food on the ground. Ground squirrels have short tails and sturdy forelegs designed for digging. Ground squirrels are colonists, watching out for each other and giving verbal warnings when they sense danger.</p></font>

<font color="white"><h2>Flying Squirrels</h2></font>
<font color="white"><p>Flying squirrels are the only nocturnal squirrel. They have parachute-like flaps of skin on their sides that connect to their front wrists and back heels allowing them to glide up to 150ft. The northern flying squirrel and southern flying squirrel are the two species found in the United States.</p></font>
