More than 200 species of squirrels are found throughout the world; only Antarctica, Australia, Madagascar, New Zealand 
and southern South America have none. All squirrel species are one of three types: tree squirrels, ground squirrels and 
flying squirrels. They play an important part in controlling insect populations, distributing seeds, aerating soil and pollinating plants. Different species of squirrels range in length from 5 inches to 3 feet.

Tree Squirrels

Gray squirrels, black squirrels, red squirrels, fox squirrels and tufted-ear squirrels are few breeds of tree squirrel. 
Tree squirrels have long bushy tails and sharp claws. They build nests in hollow tree trunks or in the forks of branches.
 Tree squirrels hide their food in many different small caches in the fall. During winter they rely on these caches for 
meals.

Ground Squirrels

Chipmunks, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and marmots are considered ground squirrels. They sleep, mate and nest in
 tunnels or burrows underground, spending their days foraging for food on the ground. Ground squirrels have short 
tails and sturdy forelegs designed for digging. Ground squirrels are colonists, watching out for each other and giving 
verbal warnings when they sense danger. 

Flying Squirrels

Flying squirrels are the only nocturnal squirrel. They have parachute-like flaps of skin on their sides that
 connect to their front wrists and back heels allowing them to glide up to 150ft. The northern flying squirrel
 and southern flying squirrel are the two species found in the United States.

Diet

Squirrels diet includes seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, berries, roots, leaves, flowers, pine cones, mushrooms, 
insects, bird eggs and newly hatched baby birds. Their diet varies to the region there located.
